# WhatsZip Viewer

**View your WhatsApp chat exports, including all media, privately and offline on your Android device!**

WhatsZip Viewer is a mobile application designed to help you easily access and browse your WhatsApp chat history that has been exported as a `.zip` file. It's built with privacy at its core, ensuring all your data processing happens directly on your device without any uploads to external servers.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Complete Privacy:** All chat data is processed and stored locally on your device. Nothing is uploaded, collected, or shared with any external servers or third parties.

* **Full Media Support:** Seamlessly view attached photos (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP), play videos (MP4, 3GP), and listen to audio messages (OPUS) directly within the app.

* **Interactive Links:** Clickable web links within your chat messages open automatically in your device's default web browser.

* **Easy Navigation:** Scroll through your entire chat history with a familiar, intuitive interface.

* **Mobile Friendly:** Designed for a smooth and responsive experience on various Android mobile devices.

* **System Messages Display:** Clearly differentiates system messages (e.g., "created this group," "added you," "left the group") from regular conversations, displaying them in a distinct, centered style.

* **Offline Functionality:** Once installed, the app works entirely offline, requiring no internet connection to view your chat exports.

* **Copy Message Details:** Double-tap on any message bubble to copy its content, sender, and timestamp to your clipboard.

## üöÄ How It Works

WhatsZip Viewer simplifies viewing your WhatsApp chat exports in just a few steps:

1.  **Export Chat from WhatsApp:**

    * Open the WhatsApp chat you wish to view.

    * Tap on "More Options" (usually three dots in the top right corner).

    * Select "More" > "Export chat".

    * Choose "Include media" when prompted. This will generate a `.zip` file containing your chat history (as a `.txt` file) and all attached media.

    * Save this `.zip` file to your device (e.g., your Downloads folder).

2.  **Select Zip in WhatsZip Viewer:**

    * Open the WhatsZip Viewer app on your Android device.

    * Tap the **"+" (Add)** button (usually in the top right corner).

    * Navigate to and select the exported `.zip` file from your device's storage.

3.  **View Your Chat:**

    * The app will process the zip file and display your entire chat history, including all media, instantly within the app.

## üîí Privacy Policy

* **No Data Collection:** The App itself **DOES NOT** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data from your device.

* **Local Processing:** All data processing, including parsing chat files and rendering media, happens exclusively on your device.

* **Temporary Files:** Any temporary files created for media playback are deleted when the app closes or the media is no longer needed. They are never retained or uploaded.
